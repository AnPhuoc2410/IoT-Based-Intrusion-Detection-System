# IoT-Based Intrusion Detection System Using NodeMCU and Arduino

## üìò Overview

This project presents an **IoT-based intrusion detection system** that combines **NodeMCU** and **Arduino** to create a cost-effective, reliable home and office security solution.
The system detects motion using a **PIR sensor**, receives signals via an **IR sensor**, and triggers **LED** and **buzzer** alerts when an intrusion occurs.

## üß© Components Used

| Component             | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** | Connects to Wi-Fi and sends intrusion alerts to Blynk or server.       |
| **Arduino Uno R3**    | Acts as main controller, reading sensor inputs and triggering outputs. |
| **PIR Sensor**        | Detects motion by measuring infrared light from nearby objects.        |
| **IR Sensor**         | Receives remote control signals.                                       |
| **LED Light**         | Visual indicator that turns on upon intrusion detection.               |
| **Buzzer**            | Audible alarm to alert intrusion.                                      |
| **RTC Module**        | Keeps real-time clock data and timestamps intrusion events.            |

## üß† Software Logic

The Arduino and NodeMCU are programmed using **Arduino IDE**.

**Main logic flow:**

1. Initialize all components.
2. Continuously monitor sensor input.
3. If motion detected by PIR sensor:

   * Turn ON LED.
   * Activate buzzer.
   * Send intrusion alert via Wi-Fi.

---

## üìä Results & Discussion

* The prototype successfully detected motion using the PIR sensor.
* The LED and buzzer were triggered instantly upon intrusion detection.
* The NodeMCU provided Wi-Fi connectivity for real-time alerts.
* The system can be extended to support remote monitoring and smart home integration.
